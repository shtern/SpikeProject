SpikeProject
============

Оптический анализ нейрональных культур

This application is designed for analyzing data stream, coming from microscope FireWire camera, detecing neural culture's fluorescense,
caused by Calcium Imaging.
At the moment, the application builds common and separated spike characterisrics graphs, builds the average line of separated spike graphs
before and after stimulation and then, normalizes the graph of average lines.
